# OOP-ATM-Machine
A simple Python-based ATM simulator using Object-Oriented Programming. Features include PIN verification, balance check, deposit, and withdrawal with proper validation and user-friendly console interaction. Ideal for beginners to understand OOP concepts like classes, methods, and encapsulation.


# 🏧 ATM Simulator in Python

A simple console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as classes, methods, encapsulation, and user interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ PIN verification with 3 attempts
- 💰 Check account balance
- 💵 Deposit money (positive amounts only)
- 💸 Withdraw money (with sufficient balance)
- 🔐 Prevent access without authentication
- 👋 Exit the session safely

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
